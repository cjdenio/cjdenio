ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Caleb.

I'm simply an 18-year-old person who writes code.

Most of my work is built with Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Ruby.

I'm most proud of:

- [Underpass](https://github.com/cjdenio/underpass) (Go)
- [shorty](https://github.com/cjdenio/shorty) (Rust)
- ~~[Resolute](https://github.com/resoluteapp/resolute) (Ruby)~~ work in progress

I'm currently an engineer on [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank). Teenager? You should join [the Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack)!

Best way to get in touch with me right now is probably [Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/CalebDenio).
