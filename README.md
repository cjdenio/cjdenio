ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Caleb.

I'm currently a high-school student who likes coding. A lot.

Most of my work is built with Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Ruby.

I'm most proud of:

- [Underpass](https://github.com/cjdenio/underpass) (Go)
- [shorty](https://github.com/cjdenio/shorty) (Rust)
- [Resolute](https://github.com/resoluteapp/resolute) (Ruby)

I'm also an active [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) member and contributor.

Best way to get in touch with me right now is probably [Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/CalebDenio).
