ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Caleb.

I'm simply a 21-year-old person who occasionally writes code.

Most of my work is built with Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Ruby.

I'm most proud of:

- working on [HCB](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb)
- [Underpass](https://github.com/cjdenio/underpass) (Go)
- [shorty](https://github.com/cjdenio/shorty) (Rust)

I can be reached at [me@calebden.io](mailto:me@calebden.io). Send me your favorite Mario character!
