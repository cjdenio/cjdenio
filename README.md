ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. I'm Caleb.

I'm simply a 20-year-old person who occationally writes code.

Most of my work is built with Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Ruby.

I'm most proud of:

- [Underpass](https://github.com/cjdenio/underpass) (Go)
- [shorty](https://github.com/cjdenio/shorty) (Rust)

Best way to get in touch with me right now is probably [Twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/CalebDenio).
